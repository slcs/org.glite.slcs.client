		<p>
			A simple but powerful java library allowing analysis and manipulation of parts of an HTML document, including some common server-side tags, while
			reproducing verbatim any unrecognised or invalid HTML.
			Also provides high-level HTML form manipulation functions.
		</p>
		<p>
		 For an introduction to the API, the documentation of the {@link au.id.jericho.lib.html.Source} class is the best place to start.
